This app will prompt you to answer questions about your team to create an HTML site to easily access your team's information.  You’ll enter your team's name, add one employee at a time, their email address, and based on their role in the company, you will have the option to add information specific to that role. For example, selecting an engineer will guide you to add their Github username. At the end of it all, you’ll have a quality website uniquely rendered for the information you provide.
